RESULTS
-----------------------
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation
conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so
conceived and so dedicated can long endure We are met on a great battlefield of that war
We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who
here gave their lives that that nation might live It is altogether fitting and proper
that we should do this
But in a larger sense we can not dedicate  we can not consecrate  we can not hallow
this ground The brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it
far above our poor power to add or detract The world will little note nor long remember
what we say here but it can never forget what they did here It is for us the living rather
to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly
advanced It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us 
that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave
the last full measure of devotion  that we here highly resolve that these dead shall
not have died in vain  that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom
and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish
from the earth
